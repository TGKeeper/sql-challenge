# Mod 9 - SQL challenge
This is a homework assignment for module 9. 
In the first sql file (Mod 9 challenge - Runser.sql) I created six tables then imported data from the csv files in the Starter_Code folder. 

# NOTE: If anyone testing the code intends to run it from beginning to end, you  will need to use the Object Explorer to import the csv files in the data folder again.  They need to be imported in the order they appear in the code, not the folder.
The tables are:<br>
• tbl_title: A table that contains the title ID and title name of various employee roles.<br>
• tbl_employees: A table that contains the employee number, title ID, birth date, first name, last name, sex, and hire date of each employee.<br>
• tbl_dept: A table that contains the dept. number and name of each department.<br>
• tbl_deptmngr: A table that contains the department number and employee number of each department manager.<br>
• tbl_emp_dept: A table that contains the employee number and department number of each employee’s department.<br>
• tbl_salaries: A table that contains the employee number and salary of each employee.<br>

In the 2nd file (Mod 9 challenge QUESTIONS - Runser.sql), I used joins & queries to answer the questions. 

The folder EmployeesSQL also contains a .png file of the table relationships.

# Credits
This project was created by me primarily referencing the material covered in class. As per usual, I did a fair bit of googling and  scanning of the documentation and came up with little to nothing of value, save for the bit about using Between to figure out the dates: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp.
